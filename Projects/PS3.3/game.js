PS.init( system, options )
Called once after engine is initialized but before event-polling begins.
This function doesn't have to do anything, although initializing the grid dimensions with PS.gridSize() is recommended.
If PS.grid() is not called, the default grid dimensions (8 x 8 beads) are applied.
Any value returned is ignored.
[system : Object] = A JavaScript object containing engine and host platform information properties; see API documentation for details.
[options : Object] = A JavaScript object with optional data properties; see API documentation for details.

// UNCOMMENT the following code BLOCK to expose the PS.init() event handler:

	// Uncomment the following code line
	// to verify operation:

	// PS.debug( "PS.init() called\n" );

	// This function should normally begin
	// with a call to PS.gridSize( x, y )
	// where x and y are the desired initial
	// dimensions of the grid.
	// Call PS.gridSize() FIRST to avoid problems!
	// The sample call below sets the grid to the
	// default dimensions (8 x 8).
	// Uncomment the following code line and change
	// the x and y parameters as needed.

	// PS.gridSize( 8, 8 );

	// This is also a good place to display
	// your game title or a welcome message
	// in the status line above the grid.
	// Uncomment the following code line and
	// change the string parameter as needed.

	PS.statusText( "Game" );
